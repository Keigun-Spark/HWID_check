# Tundra Tracker HWID and Bootloader Check

Some Kickstarter backers have received Tundra Trackers that have the incorrect Hardware ID and/or bootloader firmware revision.  This package is intended to look for these issues and repair if the user accepts the changes.

These scripts must run on a Microsoft Windows PC.  It is only tested on Windows 10 and 11.

Many of these tools are dangerous to use and can cause damage to devices that are not Tundra Tracker.  Safety mechanisms have been build into the run_hwid_check.bat script but it is still required that:

***ALL STEAMVR DEVICES OTHER THAN THE TUNDRA TRACKER THAT YOU WANT TO CHECK ARE DISCONNECTED FROM YOU PC***

This includes HMDs, Controllers, etc.

# How to use this tool:

1) Download the .zip file from github
2) Extract the zip file to your pc
3) Double click the `run_hwid_check.bat`
4) Follow On screen instructions
